        <p>401ks have the disadvantage of allowing a minimum amount of securities. My 401k offers funds with fees that are a bit larger than my liking.
            Notably, the 2065 target fund has a 0.67% expense ratio, which isnt particularly bad historically, but Vanguard's 2065 target fund only cost 0.09%. We are in a new era of low cost investing.
            My hypothetical $50,000 grows to $342,423 with an 8% gain over 25 years, but a 8.58% rate yields an epic $391,485! I am losing my principle from this fee!
            Perhaps I am better off in the 0.27% Large Cap fund that largely tracks the S&P 500. No international or bonds, but I can get those elseway. 0.27% yields $375,579
