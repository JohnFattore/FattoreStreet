            <h3>Fattore's Investing Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy and HOLD. Time in the market is most important, you cant time the market. 
                    Holding for an extending period of time averages out the good and bad years, resulting in an average return, which is pretty solid at 8-10%. 
                    One could double their money about every 10 years, or 4X in 20 years, or 16x in 40 years!</li>
                <li>Keep it Simple. A 3 fund portfolio of the S&P 500, international stock, and bonds keeps the portfolio simple and maximizes returns</li>
                <li>Don't pick individual stocks. Even professional traders struggle to beat the market (proof). You are not Warren Buffett</li>
                <li>Dollar cost average / automate investing. Periodically buying into funds will ensure an good average cost basis and makes it simple</li>
                <li>Tax advantage accounts / Save for retirement first. Take advantage of tax advantage accounts and save for retirement first</li>
                <li>Bad debt. Any debt larger than a money market account I would consider bad debt. Pay this off first before investing. Paying off debt can be seen as a guaranteed return</li>
            </ul>
