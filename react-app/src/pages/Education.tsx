            <h3>Fattore's Investing Principles</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy and HOLD. Time in the market is most important, you cant time the market. 
                    Holding for an extending period of time averages out the good and bad years, resulting in an average return, which is pretty solid at 8-10%. 
                    One could double their money about every 10 years, or 4X in 20 years, or 16x in 40 years!</li>
                <li>Keep it Simple. A 3 fund portfolio of the S&P 500, international stock, and bonds keeps the portfolio simple and maximizes returns</li>
                <li>High Yield Savings Accounts</li>
                <li>A stock is a small ownership in a company. Buying small parts of a company yields future returns because you are investing something that makes money. More established companies even give out a little money each quarter in the form of a dividend to repay the shareholder. Companies carry risk to account for these great gains, which means the investment takes time to mature and show its full return potential.</li>
                <li>Don't pick individual stocks. Even professional traders struggle to beat the market (proof). Active fund managers struggle to beat the market in the long run. 
                    A big reason for this is the large expense ratios these funds charge. If a fund charge 1.5% a year, that means the fund needs to outperform the market by 1.5% to break even.
                    These fund managers struggle to even beat the market without this mark up. Good passive funds charge essentially nothing (0.05%). You are not Warren Buffett.</li>
                <li>Dollar cost average / automate investing. Periodically buying into funds will ensure an good average cost basis and makes it simple
                    An interactive tool would be cool to show potential returns over time. I started buying in 2015, 5 years what do I have now.

                </li>
                <li>Tax advantage accounts / Save for retirement first. Take advantage of tax advantage accounts and save for retirement first</li>
                <li>Bad debt. Any debt larger than a money market account I would consider bad debt. Pay this off first before investing. Paying off debt can be seen as a guaranteed return</li>
            </ul>
