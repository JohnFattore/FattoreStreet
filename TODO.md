# Django
- real time trader
- rename S&P500Price to be something more generic, want to include other benchmarks i think
- tests for celery tasks

# React
- Nominal vs real returns
- Asset view updates
- More benchmarks
- Does the reducers properly handle logout? Does logging out remove reviews, assets etc
